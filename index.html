        <h2>About the series</h2>
        <p>
          Its a film where the girl in black dress dancing to the Ledi Gaga's
          song "I dance dance dance with my hands hands hands". She killed one
          boy in her first school, so she needed to change school. Wednesday's
          parents chose the school "Nevermore" for her. In this school she met a
          girl Enid and she became her friend, but i think that they could be a
          good couple üñ§. Wednesday also has two boyfriends.

        <h2>Wednesday is cool</h2>
        <p>
          I liked this film because Wednesday is like me. She is sad, depressed
          and angry. She never smiles and laughs and i am tooüíî Wednesday always
          wears black clothes because she is cool.

        <h2>Why i love this show</h2>
        <p>
          In some moments in this movie i was really scared. But film
          "Wednesday" not only scary. It also funny, because Wednesday often
          told jokes which made me laugh. I wouldn't change anything because
          Wednesday is the best film. It shows teenage life and also their
          issues.

          I recommend this film because it has some interesting plot twists. It
          shows teenage life and also their issues. I also recommend it because
          there is Xavier. He is pretty.
